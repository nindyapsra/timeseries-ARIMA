# timeseries-ARIMA
AutoARIMA implementation for simple time series forecasting

# Dataset
I used dataset of Indonesia Consumer Price Index from January 2014 - July 2019. And this project is prediction for the 12 months after July 2019. I got this dataset from website Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) Indonesia online, then I change it to .csv format

# Evaluation
I used MSE and RMSE for evaluation the model "is the model good or not for prediction"

# Project
1. ARIMA_MODEL = create an ARIMA model and save the model as model.pkl
2. prediction = for predict the next month using model.pkl
